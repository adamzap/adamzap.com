Reteach is a Python program that converts [Blackboard] course backups to
[Moodle] course backups. Its initial release was in 2010.

### Backstory

I was a full-time [Moodle] developer at [Louisiana State University] from 2008
to 2012. Most of my job was to write PHP code for Moodle, but I also had side
projects. One of them was writing software that converted course backups from
our legacy learning management systems to Moodle. I wrote it in Python, and it
was some of the most fun I had at that job.

The project was a success. We converted thousands of real courses to Moodle
with the program I had written. I even got to open-source it.

Word about the course converter started to get around in the Moodle community.
All kinds of organizations needed high-quality, hands-free course conversions
done in bulk.

A large school district across the country contacted me about writing similar
software for them. The concept was the same, but they were moving from a far
more recent version of Blackboard. Much had changed, so I started from scratch
and wrote Reteach. My client was nice enough to let me open-source it once the
job was done.

Everything went well, and I got a taste of doing contract work while also
having a full-time job. I learned a lot. I did a few other contract jobs based
around Reteach in the next year or two. As I write this, I haven't touched the
code in years.

I'm thankful to have been able to develop and open-source Reteach. According to
[PyPi], people are still downloading it today.
