title: Music
date: 2015-11-05

I started playing guitar in 2004. Since then I've released a small collection
of songs, many of which are covers of old video game music that I entered into
the [Dwelling of Duels] contest.

Below is a playlist and some additional information about pretty much
everything I've released.

### Zelda's Alarm Clock

A cover of [Zelda's Lullaby from Ocarina of Time for N64]. It was released in
October of 2015.

### The Joy of Sliding

A cover of [the Wily 3-4 music from Mega Man 3 for NES]. It was released in
August of 2015.

For this song, I used a [DigiTech Drop pedal] to tune my guitar to Drop B.

### Princess Swellda

A cover of [the Princess Zelda Theme] that plays at the end of Zelda II: The
Adventure of Link. It was released in February of 2015.

My friend Cody Smith helped a lot with the guitar tracking on this song. We
used his [Kemper Profiling Amp] to get a lot of the guitar tones.

### Doom in the Desert Sky

A cover of [the Desert Theme from Super Mario Bros. 3]. It was released in
August of 2013.

The riveting [Mario] impression was performed by Cody Smith.

### I'm Batman

A cover of [the Stage 3 music from Batman for NES]. It was released in February
of 2011. My friend [Jared Williams] is featured on bass.

The breakdown at the end still makes me laugh!

### Forest of Illusion of Doom

A cover of [the Forest of Illusion theme from Super Mario World]. It was
released in October of 2010.

### Terminator 2: Birthday Day

A cover of [the main theme from Terminator 2: Judgement Day]. I made it for
a friend of mine's birthday. It was released in May of 2010.

I hope to do another Terminator tribute song in the future!

### As I Lay Confined in an R.C. Car

A cover of [the title theme from R.C. Pro Am] was my first song. It was
released in February of 2010.

The title is a reference to [Confined by As I Lay Dying]. I pretty much covered
the R.C. Pro Am song in the style of Confined and added a few other elements.
